## Introduction
Would You Rather is a fun and interactive multiple-choice game built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.  
Players are presented with a series of either/or questions and must choose the option they prefer.  
The game keeps track of the player's score and provides feedback on their choices.  
I used AWS DynamoDB (a managed NoSQL database service) to store the questions data, API Gateway to act as a proxy between the frontend and Lambda functions, and Lambda to handle the logic and retrieve data from DynamoDB.
